- Always review the current code base before suggesting any changes.
- Always refer to [requirements.md](mdc:requirements.md) to help guide implementation. If there's ever a question about the requirements or multiple options, those options should be presented to me and I want to make the final decision.
- Always update [requirements.md](mdc:requirements.md) whenever we make updates to the requirements or add more details.
